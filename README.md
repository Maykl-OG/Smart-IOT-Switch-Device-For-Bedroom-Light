# Smart IOT Switch Device For Bedroom Light With ESP32
## Overview
This project implements an IoT-based Smart Switch using the ESP32 microcontroller. The system enables users to remotely control electrical devices (e.g., bedroom lights) through a local web server, eliminating the need to physically access the wall switch.

The motivation originated from a personal challenge: difficulty falling asleep because the light was left on. To address this, I leveraged ChatGPT to generate the initial source code, then iteratively debugged and optimized it to meet the specific requirements of this project.
